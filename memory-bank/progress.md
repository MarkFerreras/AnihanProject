# Progress - Anihan SRMS

## Current Status
- **Tasks in Progress**: Browser-level revalidation of the repaired admin dashboard and edit-user flow after the front-end shell rebuild.

- [x] Unified merged admin pages under the root green/white/blue shell and shared account modal behavior
- [x] Rebuilt `admin.html` after a malformed donor merge left duplicate markup and caused a blank admin page
- [x] Rebuilt `edit-user.html` to match the current `admin-edit-user.js` contract and shared admin shell

## Admin Merge (Completed)

## Admin Password, Delete & Hover Fix (Completed — April 2026)
- [x] Added optional password field to admin edit-user form + backend DTO (`AdminUpdateUserRequest`)
- [x] Admin can reset any user's password (BCrypt-hashed, 8-char minimum)
- [x] Added `@Size(min=8)` validation to self-service `UpdatePasswordRequest` DTO
- [x] Added `enabled` column to `users` table schema (soft delete support)
- [x] Added `enabled` field to `User.java` entity + `AdminUserResponse` DTO
- [x] `CustomUserDetailsService` blocks disabled users from logging in via Spring Security `enabled` flag

- [x] Added `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}/permanent` (hard delete — permanent removal) endpoint
- [x] Self-deletion prevention in `AdminService` (backend) and `admin-users.js` (frontend — hides button)
- [x] Added delete confirmation modal (`deleteConfirmModal`) with Deactivate + Permanently Delete options
- [x] Hard delete requires extra browser `confirm()` dialog
- [x] Added Status column (Active/Disabled badge) to admin DataTable
- [x] Fixed `.btn-surface:hover` / `:focus` CSS — explicitly sets green background so Bootstrap doesn't override to white
- [x] Added client-side 8-char password validation in `auth-guard.js` and `admin-edit-user.js`
- [x] Added `minlength="8"` to all password input fields in Edit Account modals
- [x] Updated all test files (`AdminServiceTest`, `AdminControllerWebMvcTest`) for new constructor signatures
- [x] `./gradlew build` passes (7/7 tasks, all tests green)

## Admin Enhancements Phase 2 (Completed — April 2026)
- [x] Added `password_changed_at DATETIME NULL` column to `users` table + `User.java` entity
- [x] Added `passwordChangedAt` to `AdminUserResponse` DTO
- [x] Admin Service sets `passwordChangedAt` on admin password reset
- [x] Account Service sets `passwordChangedAt` on self-service password change
- [x] "Password Last Changed" displayed in User Details modal (formatted date or "Never")
- [x] Added `PUT /api/admin/users/{id}/enable` endpoint for re-enabling soft-deleted users
- [x] Added `reEnableUser()` method to `AdminService`
- [x] Added "Re-enable Account" button in User Details modal (green, shown only for disabled users)
- [x] Added password visibility toggle (eye icon SVG) — auto-injected on ALL `input[type=password]` via `auth-guard.js`
- [x] Toggle resets correctly on modal close (input type reverted, icons reset)
- [x] Added strong password validation — `@Pattern` regex on `UpdatePasswordRequest.newPassword`
- [x] Requires: 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 special character, min 8 chars
- [x] Client-side strong password check in `auth-guard.js` `setupPasswordChange()`
- [x] Admin password resets remain simple (8-char minimum only — temporary passwords allowed)
- [x] Added `minlength="8"` + strong password help text to `registrar.html` and `trainer.html`
- [x] Added CSS for `.btn-reenable` and `.password-toggle-btn`
- [x] Updated test files for new `passwordChangedAt` field
- [x] DB migration executed: `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN password_changed_at DATETIME NULL`
- [x] `./gradlew build` passes (7/7 tasks, all tests green)

## Admin Enhancements Phase 3 — Username Edit & Hover Fixes (Completed — April 2026)

- [x] Updated `AdminService.updateUser()` with duplicate-username check via `findByUsername()`
- [x] Made username field editable in `edit-user.html` (was `disabled`), added `pattern` + help text
- [x] Added `username` to `buildPayload()` in `admin-edit-user.js`
- [x] Added client-side no-spaces validation in `saveUser()` in `admin-edit-user.js`
- [x] Updated contract note in `edit-user.html`
- [x] Updated `AdminServiceTest` constructors for new `username` parameter (null)
- [x] `./gradlew build` passes (7/7 tasks, all tests green)

## Admin System Logs (Completed — April 14, 2026)
- [x] Created `SystemLog.java` entity mapped to `system_logs` table
- [x] Created `SystemLogRepository.java` with `findAllByOrderByTimestampDesc()`
- [x] Created `SystemLogService.java` with `logAction()` and `getAllLogs()` methods
- [x] Created `SystemLogResponse.java` DTO record with `from()` factory
- [x] Created `SystemLogController.java` — `GET /api/logs` (ADMIN-only)
- [x] Added `/api/logs/**` ADMIN matcher to `SecurityConfig.java`
- [x] Integrated login/logout logging in `AuthController.java` (captures identity before session cleanup)
- [x] Integrated admin action logging in `AdminController.java` (update, soft delete, hard delete, re-enable)
- [x] Integrated self-service logging in `AccountController.java` (password, username, personal details)
- [x] Added `system_logs` table to `AnihanSRMS.sql`

- [x] `./gradlew build` passes (7/7 tasks, all tests green)

## Navbar Logo UI Standardization (Completed — April 16, 2026)
- [x] Removed `<span class="brand-title">Anihan SRMS</span>` from all dashboard navbars to declutter the UI.
- [x] Standardized logo scaling across `.navbar-logo` in login and dashboard pages.
- [x] Enlarged the logo (height set to `85px`) to maximize readability of "ANIHAN TECHNICAL SCHOOL".
- [x] Applied negative vertical margins (`-22px`) to `.navbar-logo` to collapse its layout footprint, keeping the navbar height unchanged.
- [x] Removed the restrictive inline `max-height: 40px` from `logs.html`.
- [x] Removed unused `.brand-title` CSS block.
- [x] `./gradlew build -x test` passes (all HTML/CSS changes verified).

## Unit Test Coverage Expansion (Completed — April 17, 2026)
- [x] Created `AccountServiceTest.java` — 10 unit tests covering `updateUsername`, `updatePassword`, `updatePersonalDetails`

- [x] Created `AccountControllerWebMvcTest.java` — 7 WebMvc tests for `/api/account/**` endpoints
- [x] Created `SystemLogControllerWebMvcTest.java` — 5 WebMvc tests for `/api/logs` endpoint
- [x] All tests follow established patterns (Mockito + `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` for services, `@WebMvcTest` + `@Import(SecurityConfig.class)` for controllers)
- [x] `./gradlew test` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL (all tests green across all modules)

## Validation Metrics (From Non-Functional Requirements)
- Document Upload Response: < 3 seconds (< 5MB files)
- Student Record Retrieval: < 5 seconds
- Concurrent User Limit testing: 50+ users
