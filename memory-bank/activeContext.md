# Active Context - Anihan SRMS

## Current Phase
**Schema Drift Remediation + DataSeeder Removal (2026-05-05)**

## Active Branch
`main` (working uncommitted per user instruction — no commit, no feature branch)

## Latest Session (May 5, 2026)
- Diagnosed live `AnihanSRMS` database vs. `schema.sql` / `AnihanSRMS.sql` and JPA entities
- Found drift on three tables and a single failing test (`SpringbootApplicationTests > contextLoads()` — `Unknown column 'sr1_0.civil_status' in 'field list'`)
- Wrote and applied migration `src/main/sql/migrations/2026-05-05-fix-schema-drift.sql`:
  - Added `civil_status VARCHAR(50) NULL` to `student_records` (idempotent guard via `information_schema`)
  - Relaxed 12 columns on `student_records` from `NOT NULL` → `NULL` to match `StudentRecord.java`
  - Relaxed 9 columns on `parents` (incl. dropping `est_income DEFAULT 0.00`)
  - Relaxed 6 columns on `other_guardians`
- Deleted `src/main/java/com/example/springboot/config/DataSeeder.java` — application data must come from the database, not hard-coded startup seeding
- Refreshed `schema.sql` and `AnihanSRMS.sql` headers (date + drift-migration cross-reference for other developers)
- `./gradlew test` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL — 82/82 tests pass (previous run was 81/82)

## Verified
- Live DB now has all 17 tables, `civil_status` present, all column nullability matches JPA entities
- `SpringbootApplicationTests > contextLoads()` passes against the real MySQL container
- No remaining references to `DataSeeder` outside memory-bank historical notes

## Previous Session (May 3, 2026)
- Added mandatory field validation across enrollment wizard Steps 1–3
- Step 1: Civil Status now required (added to `STEP_REQUIRED`)
- Step 2: ID Photo upload always required; Baptism Date, Baptism Place, and Baptismal Certificate conditionally required when "Baptized" checkbox is checked
- Step 3: Father and Mother core fields required (Family Name, First Name, Occupation, Contact No., Address); Guardian fields remain optional
- Added `STEP_CUSTOM_VALIDATORS` pattern for runtime-dependent validation (file uploads, conditional fields)
- Updated `validateStep()`, `validateAll()`, `clearValidation()` to merge custom validators
- Added `*` asterisk markers to all newly-required field labels in HTML
- Added "Fields marked * are required" note to Steps 2 and 3 (Step 1 already had it)
- Bumped JS cache version v=2 → v=3
- `./gradlew test` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- **Branch:** `feature/student-field-validation`

## Previous Session (May 2, 2026 — session 3)
- Full database cross-check: live `AnihanSRMS` vs `AnihanSRMS.sql` + `schema.sql`
- Dropped 4 legacy empty tables: `classess`, `log`, `previous_school`, `qualification_assessment`
- Changed `student_records` PK from `student_id` → `record_id` (matching SQL files + JPA entity)
- Added missing `civil_status` column to `student_records`
- Fixed nullability on `student_records` (12 columns NOT NULL → NULL)
- Fixed nullability on `parents` (9 columns NOT NULL → NULL)
- Fixed nullability on `other_guardians` (6 columns NOT NULL → NULL)
- Fixed `documents.upload_date` type from TIMESTAMP → DATETIME
- Inserted seed data: 1 course (CARS), 3 batches, 3 sections
- Kept existing user accounts (user_id 2, 3, 4) — not overwritten
- `./gradlew test` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL — all tests pass
- Database now has exactly 17 tables matching both SQL files
**Student Status Dropdown + Badge Colors (2026-05-04)**

## Latest Session (May 4, 2026)
- Replaced `<input list>` + `<datalist>` for Status on `student-records.html` with a `<select>` dropdown — 3 options: Enrolling, Active, Graduated. "Submitted" removed as an option (transitional state only).
- Rewrote `renderStatusBadge()` in `registrar-students.js` — 4-way logic: Active → green, Enrolling/Submitted → grey (`.status-badge-enrolling`), Graduated → blue (`.status-badge-graduated`), unknown → red.
- Added `.status-badge-enrolling` and `.status-badge-graduated` CSS classes to `dashboard.css`.
- Verified by Chapter 3 FR 3.1: exactly 3 official registrar-managed statuses (Enrolling, Active, Graduated); Submitted is portal-set transitional state.

## Previous Session (May 2, 2026 — session 2)
- Fixed search bar CSS: added `.dt-search input` selector alongside `.dataTables_filter input` to cover DataTables 2's class structure
- Fixed batch year filter inputs: added `width: 90px; max-width: 90px; flex: 0 0 auto` to `#batchFromYear, #batchToYear` to prevent Bootstrap `form-control` 100% stretch
- Created `DataSeeder.java` (`@Component CommandLineRunner`) — idempotent; seeds CARS course, 3 batches, 3 sections, 5 student records on app startup; skips records that already exist
- `./gradlew test` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL — 82 tests, 0 failures
- **Open follow-up**: replace empty `profilePicture` byte[0] with real images. Image folder is `src/main/resources/static/images/`

## Previous Session (May 2, 2026 — session 1)
- Wider search input scoped to `#studentRecordsTable_wrapper`
- New Batch Year From/To filter on registrar home (server-side via `?fromYear/&toYear`)
- `schema.sql` now seeds 1 course + 3 batches + 3 sections + 5 dummy student records (years 2024–2026)
- 4 new tests (1 service + 3 WebMvc), full suite: 82 tests, 0 failures

## Latest Session (May 1, 2026 — evening)
- New endpoint: `GET /api/registrar/student-records?q=<query>` (optional query param, in-memory case-insensitive filter)
- New JUnit tests:
  - `RegistrarBulkLoadTest` (Mockito, 200 records, 3 tests covering list correctness, performance, and search)
  - `RegistrarBulkLoadWebMvcTest` (WebMvc, 200 records, 2 tests including `?q=` parameter forwarding)
  - `StudentRecordH2LoadTest` (`@DataJpaTest` + H2 in-memory in MySQL compatibility mode, 100 records via real JPA, fully isolated from the live MySQL)
- New dependency: `testRuntimeOnly("com.h2database:h2")`
- Spring Boot 4.0 reorganized test annotation packages — `DataJpaTest` and `AutoConfigureTestDatabase` are at new paths
- Full suite: 79 tests, 0 failures

## Latest Session (May 1, 2026 — afternoon)
- New endpoints: `PUT /api/registrar/student-records/{recordId}`, `GET /api/lookup/batches`, `GET /api/lookup/courses`
- New repositories: `BatchRepository`, `CourseRepository`
- New DTO: `StudentRecordUpdateRequest`
- New JS: `registrar-student-records-edit.js`
- `student-records.html` now a full edit form with combined free-text + datalist dropdowns and admin-pattern unsaved-changes warning
- DataTables built-in search confirmed sufficient for the registrar home table

## Session Summary (May 1, 2026)
- New API endpoints: `GET /api/registrar/student-records`, `GET /api/registrar/student-records/{recordId}` (REGISTRAR-only)
- New DTO package: `dto/registrar/` with `StudentRecordSummaryResponse` and `StudentRecordDetailsResponse`
- New service: `RegistrarService` (reuses existing `StudentRecordRepository`)
- Registrar home now displays a DataTables-powered student records table with detail modal
- `student-records.html` repurposed for registrar (placeholder page reachable from modal Edit button)

## Status (May 1, 2026)

### Registrar Navbar Standardization (May 1, 2026)
- **Task**: Add a navbar to all registrar pages matching the admin navbar pattern, with two links: Home and Subjects
- **Files Changed**:
  - `static/registrar.html` — replaced simple placeholder navbar with full Bootstrap-collapsible navbar (Home active, Subjects); added `class="dashboard-page"` to body
  - `static/subjects.html` — rebranded from admin to registrar (role, title, navbar links, portal label, brand href to `registrar.html`)
  - `config/SecurityConfig.java` — moved `subjects.html` from ADMIN matcher to REGISTRAR matcher
- **CSS**: Reused existing `admin-navbar`, `admin-nav-link`, `portal-label` classes — no new CSS
- **Subjects page content**: intentionally left as placeholder per user request (just heading + muted text)
- **Decision recorded**: Subjects page is now REGISTRAR-only; Admin no longer has access

## Status (April 30, 2026)

### Enrollment Flow Bug Audit & Fixes (April 30, 2026)
- **Task**: Audit enrollment flow for potential bugs, run JUnit tests, fix critical issues
- **Bugs Found**: 5 (see `/memory-bank/bugs.md` for full tracker)
- **Bugs Fixed This Session**:
  - Bug 3 (Critical): `Parent.java` and `OtherGuardian.java` `@JoinColumn` FK mismatch → added `referencedColumnName = "student_id"`
  - Bug 6 (Low): Duplicate security authorization rules in `SecurityConfig.java` → consolidated into single clean block
- **Bugs Deferred (Open)**:
  - Bug 4 (Medium): `student_records.email` not mapped in enrollment flow — awaiting product decision
  - Bug 5 (Medium): `AgeCalculator` returns `0` instead of `null` for missing birthdate — needs code fix
  - Bug 7 (Medium): `saveDraft()` failure silently swallowed before submit — user questions whether saveDraft is needed at all since students only have one session
- **JUnit Tests**: `./gradlew test` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL (30s, all tests pass)

### Previous Sessions
- DB Sync from AnihanSRMS.sql (April 30, 2026) — UNIQUE index on users.username
- Bug Fixes (student_records.age, StudentRecord @Id) — April 30, 2026
- Submit Button Fix — April 29, 2026
- Student Details Enrollment Wizard — April 29, 2026

## Verified
- `./gradlew test` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL — April 30
- Parent.java FK now correctly joins to `student_records.student_id`
- OtherGuardian.java FK now correctly joins to `student_records.student_id`
- SecurityConfig has no duplicate matchers
- All 9 child table FKs reference `student_records.student_id` (verified via information_schema)

## Known Issues (Open)
- See `/memory-bank/bugs.md` for full bug tracker
- Bug 4: Student email not in enrollment flow (needs product decision)
- Bug 5: AgeCalculator returns 0 instead of null
- Bug 7: saveDraft architecture question (one-session design vs. crash recovery)
- Tests not yet updated for student enrollment module (TD-1)
- `student-records.html` still has old admin navbar (TD-2 — `subjects.html` resolved 2026-05-01 via registrar rebrand)
- `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none` — all schema changes must be done via SQL manually
